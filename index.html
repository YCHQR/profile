      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a 22 years old Moroccan-Canadian that graduated from Northeastern University in Boston in 2020 with a BSBA in Entrepreneurship & New Venture Management. Currently trainee at the LeWagon Milano Web Development bootcamp, and future candidate for a Dual Degree Masters in 2021 at IE University in Madrid. Also, I am deeply passionate about electronic music, djing and producing ðŸŽ§.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I chose Le Wagon?</h3>
      <p>
        Since highschool Iâ€™m really interested in programming and tech in general. In highschool I did an IT & Computer Science class where I learned to code in Python (only basics), and also a little html & css, but I always thought that there was so much more to learn about. As I just finished my Bachelor degree, between my graduation and the start of my Masters degree I had a few months free, I thought that it would be the best opportunity for me to dive back into the programming world. In addition, my Masters will be in Digital Business and Innovation, I thought that it would be great to learn about the technical part of digital business, and be fully and intensely immersed into it before the starting my Masters.
